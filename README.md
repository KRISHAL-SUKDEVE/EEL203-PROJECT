# EEL203-PROJECT
This repository contains my Digital Logic Design Project built using Xilinx Vivado. It includes RTL design files, testbenches, simulation results, block diagrams, and a complete project report. The goal is to design, implement, and verify a working digital system using Verilog and FPGA-based workflows.
